# 👋 Hi, I'm Nik

I'm a data analyst in training with a background in chemistry and a growing passion for uncovering insights through data.

After graduating during the pandemic and working in mortgage compliance for over three years, I decided to pursue a more analytical and creative career path. Since then, I’ve been building a portfolio of real-world data projects using Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau — with a focus on storytelling, problem-solving, and business impact.
